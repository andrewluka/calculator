You can enter digits normally. Eg: 123, etc.
Same with basic arithmetic operators:
'+' for addition,
'-' for subtraction,
'*' for multiplication and
'/' for division.

Note: brackets/brackets and constants next to each other without an operator are assumed to be multiplied.
Eg: (9)(2) = 18
    4(3 + 2) = 20

Brackets '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']' are interchangeable and mean the same thing.
Spaces are ignored.

You can use decimals:
Eg: 4.8 + 1.2 = 6

Speaking of popular constants, these are supported:
Pi
For pi, just enter a lowercase p.
e (Euler's number)

Also, a list of built-in functions (don't forget to enter the brackets too!):
Absolute value: abs(value)
Just enter 'a'.

Sine: sin(angle)
Enter 's'.

Cosine: cos(angle)
Enter 'c'.

Tangent: tan(angle)
Enter 't'.

Arcsine: asin(value)
Enter 'S'.

Arccosine: acos(value)
Enter 'C'.

Arctan: atan(value)
Enter 'T'.

Nth root: NthRoot(degree of root, value under root)
Enter 'R'.


To add an exponent, surround the base in brackets and enter '^'.


Angle units are supported too:
deg (degrees): enter 'd'.
rad (radians): enter 'r'.
